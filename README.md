# Demo-officer
Mini exploratory project to demonstrate the functionality of the officer package for generating automated PowerPoint reports.

# Objectives

1.) Create fake data to emulate a "scenario analysis" using a random walk method.
2.) Save plots to disk
3.) Generate PowerPoint report starting with template, and adding a new slide with each generated image.

#### Example Plot

# Results

The resulting report generated using the officer package looked great! It was fairly easy and straight forward to get setup. I would highly recommend using this package for any reports that would need to be generated more than a few times.  As next steps, I hope to build a Shiny Application to act as a wrapper around this package (i.e. upload template and raw images, then download a report with added slides).
